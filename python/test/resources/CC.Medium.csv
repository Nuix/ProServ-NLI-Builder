NOTICE OF PENDING LITIGATION SEEKING RELIEF AND MONETARY DAMAGES UNDER FCRA SECTION 616 & SECTION 617 Please accept this final written OFFER OF SETTLEMENT BEFORE LITIGATION as my attempt to amicably resolve your continued violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regarding your refusal to delete INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated information from my consumer file. I intend to pursue litigation in accordance with the FCRA to seek relief and recover all monetary damages that I may be entitled to under Section 616 and Section 617 if the INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated items listed below are not deleted immediately. A copy of this letter as well as INACCURATE ERRONEOUS ITEMS sent to you previously will also become part of a formal complaint to the Federal Trade Commission and shall be used as evidence in pending litigation provided you fail to comply with this offer of settlement. 

YOU ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE FCRA, the unverified items listed below still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. You are required under the FCRA to have a copy of the original creditors documentation on file to verify that this information is mine and is correct. In the results of your investigations, you stated in writing that you verified that these items are being reported correctly? Who verified these accounts? You have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Furthermore you have failed to provide the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. 


Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors i see you are disregarding it so heres my breakdown. 

1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves. 

2. What is a FCRA violation? 

Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you. Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes. 

3. My rights under the fair credit reporting act Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes. 
Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions. 
Disputeand have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable. 
Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ). 


I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate and they are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated.. i recently applied for extended credit and was denied i am in distress because of your mistakes. 

The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

I was told that I would either be denied or I would have to shut down my HELOC. I am a mortgage loan originator myself, so I did some digging. It turns out, this is wrong and illegal. You can review the PMI removal requirements here : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Nowhere does it mention subordinate liens being an issue. Additionally, it indicates that lenders may not add additional requirements on their end. I pointed all this out to Round Point Mortgage, and they initially pushed back. When I threatened to bring it to the CFPB, they acquiesced. So my personal issue is resolved, but here is the problem : they are enforcing this illegal policy against countless consumers, consumers who are not savvy enough to know better. The potential financial harm to consumers is huge. The FTC will take the case, but others need to make the same complaint. Others won't because they don't even know it is happening. CFPB seems to only take the case if you have an outstanding issue, and I don't have one anymore. But someone needs to address this, and I believe the CFPB is the most equipped organization to do so.

This response was also copied to you. Case # XXXX. Because this is Citibank, they were allowed to Police themselves and to send to me a condescending response in which they did Not address my complaint. My complaint had Nothing to do with discrimination of which they seemed to want to concentrate on. My complaint was in regard to the Promotional Interest free ( within 18 months ) purchase I made. When I called to set up the Promotional Payments, they agreed to the terms I asked for in order for me to pay this balance off by the expiration date. I knew I had to continue to make payments on my regular account balance, but they NEVER informed me they were going to add that purchase into my regular account. Since I made that purchase, they have deceptively raised the required payment on the existing balance I had, and have charged me a higher interest rate on that balance, as they stack an additional interest balance on the side, in an attempt to cause me to not be able to pay this promotion off, by the expiration date. I do not understand why these companies are allowed to treat consumers in this manner. I am asking that you inestigate this matter yourselves, or is their no protection for consumers after all. I do not have Citibank money, but I do have a Brain, and I do pay my debts. I think what they are being allowed to do is absolutely foul.

I understand that it can take some time for credit reports to be updated, but it has been several years since the bankruptcy was discharged, and these accounts are still causing me a great deal of trouble. I would appreciate it if you could investigate this matter and remove these charged off accounts from my credit report. 

I have been making every effort to rebuild my credit and improve my financial situation, but these accounts are hindering my progress. I hope that you will take my situation seriously and take the necessary steps to correct this issue as soon as possible. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I was assured by the Bank of America representative that the account was closed and that I would be receiving an account closure confirmation letter within 10 business days. 
XXXX-Logged back into the Bank of America to determine and obtain any interest earned income statement for tax purposes. This is when I FIRST noticed that the checking account was still active and had a negative balance of - {$6.00}. There were deposits since my initial call from my previous employer of {$19.00} ( approx. XX/XX/XXXX ) and {$34.00} ( approx. XX/XX/XXXX ) totaling {$53.00}. The Bank charged me low balance maintenance fees for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ; {$12.00} each month totaling {$60.00}. 
XXXX-I raised a formal complaint with the Bank ( Compliaint ID # XXXX XXXX stating that the account should have been closed on XX/XX/XXXX as initially asked and all my deposits should have been blocked. However, the representatives I spoke with repeatedly instructed me to pay the Bank the negative - {$6.00} the Bank negligently caused so that I can be allowed to close the account. I refused and asked to zero out the balance and close my account. Again, they suggested it would be closed and that I would receive a confirmation letter shortly. 
XXXX-Logged into account once again and saw that the account was not closed and the negative balance increased by {$12.00} ( additional maintenance charge added for XX/XX/XXXX ) to - {$18.00}. I spoke to representative "" XXXX '' from Nevada ; employee # XXXX. I explained again the situation and her supervisor ; Senior Client Advocate ( who I did not speak to ) named XXXX refunded the account 2 months worth of maintenance fees ( {$24.00} ) to bring my account positive to {$5.00}. Again, they said it would be closed, I would receive a confirmation letter and the remaining balance on the account would be sent via postal mail. 
XX/XX/XXXX ( today ) -Logged into account again and saw the account was still active and spoke to XXXX from Deposit Department in Arkansas . I explained the situation once again and asked her if I would be billed a maintenance fee since the account was not closed earlier in the month and she could not answer this basic question. Her supervisor from the Consumer Deposit Dept, named XXXX ; employee # XXXX again assured me the account would be closed, I would receive a confirmation letter, the remaining funds in the account would be sent to me via postal mail and I will not receive another maintenance charge. After this last interaction, my account credentials used to access the account have been blocked preventing me from obtaining statements or any information about my account.

The creditors have failed to provide me with the proper notices required by the law, failed to investigate my disputes, and failed to report accurate information. 

For instance, the late payment account reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was an error on their part. I have made all payments on time, and the late payment should not have been reported. 

Additionally, the collection accounts for XXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXX were reported without proper validation of the debt. I have requested validation of these debts, but have not received any response from the creditors. 

Furthermore, the charge off accounts reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX  were reported inaccurately. The debts were paid in full, but the creditors failed to update the information on my credit report. 

In conclusion, I request that these items be removed from my credit report immediately, and that the creditors comply with all relevant consumer protection laws. Please provide me with a written response regarding the investigation of these disputes. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

My modification docs said payments will start on XX/XX/2022 and that's what the account will show. Well i called about the acct in XX/XX/2022. One person said wait to make the payment and then another would call and say make a payment. This has been going on for several months. There has been several phone calls in between then and now from the company and to the company. Most of the time I was calling them at least 1-2 times a month. They started out calling me everyday although I was going thru a modification. I told them I was waiting for them to complete the modification so I can start my payments. They would call and say Im on a modification and I would ask why they keep calling? They would tell me let me check the account oh I see you on a modification is there anything i can help you with? I would say no. This does not make any sense. I would say around XXXX I started calling them because they stopped calling. Just to make sure everything was good. On the calls they would tell me they are waiting for the buy out phase. Once the buy out phase is complete you and then start making your payments. I told them that this is not right that they are taking so long. I also stated that this is how you all make people loose their homes. So I talked to them on XX/XX/XXXX the person informs me that {$6600.00} was needed to complete the modification. I told her I didn't have that money. On XX/XX/2022 they told me I had to pay {$6600.00} or the modification would be declined and I would have to pay all he past due amount. I offered to give them {$1500.00} and pay the rest in 10 days they said no. I called back and offered {$4100.00} and rest by end of month and they said no. I am calling all I know to borrow money for the {$6600.00}. They also told me if the mod is declined I would have to do another one and they may not approve it based on how I handled this one. I told them that's not fair to me because it was not my fault that they have not processed the modification. So i had to beg and borrow to come up with the money because I didn't want to loose my home. So Im in the hole with people that I borrowed from.

We then took the check to the local credit union to cash, in my aunt 's account because I had already signed it over to her, which fifth third bank refused to honor because I did not verify who I was before the check could get verified and put my aunt 's account into negative {$2500.00} I then continued my mobile deposit on XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and while on the phone with them verified myself and the check and fifth third bank honored the check.

Per certified mail receipt, they received this letter on XX/XX/2023. 

Experian has responded to me by citing Section 605B ( c ) ( 1 ) and Section 611 ( a ) ( 3 ) ( A ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act in an attempt to hide the fact that they have not responded properly to my demand that they fulfill their legal obligation. They are attempting to claim that this alleged debt is verified without having ever done any verification. They attempt to say that it is on the creditor to correct the information, but Experian is the one furnishing this information PUBLICLY and harming MY reputation. Which makes them LIABLE and obligated to legally validate their claims.

In the letter I demanded that they send me a sworn proof of verification affidavit to show how Experian is legally claiming that the account XXXX XXXX is in fact accurate, valid, and complete ( per 15 USC 1681e ( e ) ( 1 ) ).

Because I have never received from Experian any sworn statements, affidavit of truth with notary signature, or any statements under oath - there has been no verification made under U.S. Federal Law.

I have also demanded that they have a party identified by position and authority at Experian who has first-hand-knowledge of this matter swearing that I explicitly gave Experian written instruction to furnish the XXXX  account on my consumer credit report. I demanded that they state this under oath, with their wet ink signature and have a notary present, on the previously mentioned Proof of Verification Affidavit ( Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1681b ).

I also informed them that I require to witness the original wet-ink contract that I allegedly signed which created the alleged debt which Experian is furnishing on my credit report. ( Failure to produce the original contract agreement will be evidence of fraud in the claim that I owe any debt and that Experian is allowed by law to report on my credit report. ( Pursuant to UCC 3-302 ) ) I am only attempting to have the records corrected to what they rightfully should be legally and lawfully. Each phone call, online interaction, and mail piece are being documented for this purpose.

It would be advisable that Experian assure the records they are furnishing publicly on my consumer credit report are in order before I am forced to take legal action.

I'm then told that extensions are approved on a case by case basis, and that I should not have made my payment. I was then told to yet again, call back later this month and ask again. I mentioned I'd complain to the CFPB because there has to be another remedy other than having the customer call each month. They then tell me they can offer a payment plan that would not get me caught up until XXXX, and would still accrue interest.

I made sure this was a BoA product and it was confirmed that it was "" Merchant Services, '' so I signed up. All seemed to be well for a period of time. I later noted a debit of {$10000.00} and a subsequent debit of {$3500.00}. When a large charge reaches my account I am always contacted by the bank 's Fraud Department to confirm the legitimacy of the charge. That did not occur with these transactions. Thereafter, I took notice of a number of chargebacks ( refunds ) in the account under the same institution. All of the transactions have since totaled around {$20000.00}. I called Bank of America for assistance because I was completely confused but I was told I would need to visit my local branch. Throughout several weeks I spoke with a number of people who explained to me that Bank of America discontinued it's relationship with that merchant, but did not notify any account holders. This service was again presented by, from, and as a Bank of America product. Due to this lack of communication and transparency I incurred charges and chargebacks from the company once their agreement ceased. Bank of America refused to help me dispute the charges and the reversal payments which occured as a result of them ending their contract with the service company. I explained thoroughly that only after the charges had I been told this was a partnership and they were ending their relationship. If I were made aware I would have taken the steps to do the same. Bank of America presented the service directly to me but did not any way shape or form let me know this product/service would no longer be offered. This situation is beyond unsettling because they refuse to move a toe in trying to assist me in protecting my account, disputing the charges, or getting my money returned back to me. They simply apologized and stated there is nothing they can do. They have completely thrown their hands up and not taken responsibility, not tried to help me in any way, nor explain how nor why I wasn't kept informed about anything.
